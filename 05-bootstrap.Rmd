# Bootstrap

* Bootstrap can be summarized as "simulating from an estimated model"
* It is used for inference (confidence intervals / hypothesis testing)
* It can also be used for estimating the predictive power of a model
  (similarly to cross validation) via out-of-bootstrap generalization error
  
## Motivation
Consider i.i.d. data. 
$$ Z_1, .. Z_n \sim\ P \;\; with \; \;Z_i = (X_i, Y_i)$$ 
And assume a statistical procedure
$$ \hat{\theta} = g(Z_1, ..., Z_n) $$
$g(\cdot)$ can be a point estimator for a regression coefficient, a 
non-parametric curve estimator or a generalization error estimator based on 
one new observation, e.g.
$$ \hat{\theta}_{n+1} = g(Z_1, ..., Z_{new}) = (Y_{new} - m_{Z_1, ..., Z_{new}}(X_{new})^2 $$
To make inference, we want to know the distribution of $\hat{\theta}$. For some
cases, we can derive the distribution analytically if we know the distribution
$P$. The central limit theorem states that the sum of random variables 
approximates a normal distribution with $n \rightarrow \infty$. Therefore, we
know
$$ \hat{\theta}_{n \rightarrow \infty} = n^{-1}\sum x_i \sim N(\mu_x, \sigma_x^2 / n) $$ 
for *any* $P$. However, if $\hat{\theta}$ is not a sum of random variables, 
and the CLT does not apply, it's not as straightforward to obtain the 
distribution of $\hat{\theta}$. Also, if $P$ is not the normal distribution, 
but some other distribution, we can't find the distribution of $\hat{\theta}$
easily. The script mentions the median estimator as an example for which the 
variance already depends on the density of $P$.
Hence, deriving properties of estimators analytically, even the asymptotic 
ones only, is a pain.
Therefore, if we knew $P$, we could simply simulate many times and get the 
distribution of $\hat{\theta}$ this way. That is,
draw many $(X_i, Y_i)$ from that distribution and compute $\hat{\theta}$ for 
each draw. 

The problem is that we don't know $P$. But we have a data sample
that was generated from $P$. Hence, we can instead take the **empirical** 
distribution $\hat{P}$that places probability mass of $1/n$ on each observation, draw a
sample from this distribution (which is simply drawing uniformly from our 
sample with replacement) and compute our estimate of interest from this sample.
$$ \hat{\theta}^{*} = g({Z_1}^{*}, ..., {Z_{new}}^{*})$$
We can do that many times to get an approximate distribution for $\hat{\theta}$.
A crucial assumption is that $\hat{P}$ reassembles $P$. If our data is not 
i.i.d, this may not be the case and hence bootstrapping might be misleading.
Below, we can see that i.i.d. sampling  (red line) reassembles the true 
distribution (black line) quite well, whereas biased sampling (blue line) 
obviously does not. We produce a sample that places higher probability mass on 
the large (absolute) values.
```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
pop <- data_frame(pop = rnorm(10000) * 1:10000) 
iid <- sample(pop$pop, 1000) # sample iid

# sample non-iid: sample is biased towards high absolute values
ind <- rbinom(10000, size = 1, prob = seq(0, 1, length.out = 10000)) 
not_iid <- pop$pop[as.logical(ind)] # get sample
not_iid <- sample(not_iid, 1000) # reduce sample size to 1000

out <- data_frame(iid = iid, not_iid = not_iid) %>%
  gather(type, value, iid, not_iid)
ggplot(out, aes(x = value, color = type)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  geom_density(aes(x = pop, color = NULL), data = pop)

```

We can summarize the bootstrap procedure as follows.

* draw a bootstrap sample ${Z_1}^{*}, ..., {Z_{new}}^{*}$
* compute your estimator $\hat{\theta}$ based on that sample.
* repeat the first two steps $B$ times to get bootstrap estimators 
$\hat{\theta}_1, ..., \hat{\theta}_B$ and therefore an estimate of the 
  distribution of $\hat{\theta}$.
  
Use the $B$ estimated bootstrap estimators as approximations for the bootstrap 
expectation, quantiles and so on.
$\mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta}^*_n] \approx B^{-1}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^n \hat{\theta}^{* j}_n$

## The Bootstrap Distribution
With $P^*$, we denote the bootstrap distribution, which is the conditional 
probability distribution introduced by sampling i.i.d. from the 
empirical distribution $\hat{P}$. Hence, $P^*$ of ${\hat{\theta}}^*$ is the 
distribution that arises from sampling i.i.d. from $\hat{P}$ and applying the 
transformation $g(\cdot)$ to the data. 
Conditioning on the data allows us to treat $\hat{P}$ as fixed. 


## Bootstrap Consistency
The bootstrap is is called consistent if 
$$ \mathbb{P}[a_n(\hat{\theta} - \theta) \leq x ] - \mathbb{P}[a_n(\hat{\theta}^* - \hat{\theta}) \leq x ] \rightarrow 0$$
Consistency of the bootstrap typically holds if the limiting distribution is
normal and the samples $Z_1, .., Z_n$ are i.i.d. Consistency of the bootstrap
implies consistent variance and bias estimation:

$$ \frac{Var^* (\hat{\theta}^*)}{Var(\hat{\theta})} \rightarrow 1$$
$$ \frac{\mathbb{E}^* (\hat{\theta}^*) - \hat{\theta}}{\mathbb{E}(\hat{\theta}) - \theta} \rightarrow 1$$
You can think of $\theta$ as the real parameter and $\hat{\theta}$ as the estimate
based on a sample. Similarly, in the bootstrap world, $\hat{\theta}$ is the *real*
parameter, and $\hat{\theta}^*_i$ as an estimator of the *real* parameter 
$\hat{\theta}$. The bootstrap world is an analogue of the real world. 
So in our  bootstrap simulation, we know the *true* parameter 
$\hat{\theta}$. From our simulation, we get many $\hat{\theta}^*_i$ and can 
find the bootstrap expectation
$\mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta}^*_n] \approx B^{-1}\sum\limits_{j = 1}^n \hat{\theta}^{* j}_n$.
The idea is now to generalize from the *boostrap* world to the *real* world, i.e.
by saying that the relationship between $\hat{\theta}^*$ and $\hat{\theta}$ is
similar to the one between $\hat{\theta}$ and $\theta$.

A simple trick to remember all of this is:

 * if there is no hat, add one
 * if there is a hat, add a star.
 
## Boostrap Confidence Intervals
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/pivot_ci.png")
```

Note that there confidence intervals are not simply taking the quantiles of
the bootstrap distribution. The trick is really to make use of the analogy 
between the *real* world and the *boostrap* world. So when we see our bootstrap
expectation $\mathbb{E}[\hat{\theta}^*_n]$ is way higher than $\hat{\theta}$, 
then we also should believe that our $\hat{\theta}$ is higher than $\theta$. 
The above procedure accounts for that.

## Boostrap Estimator of the Generalization Error

We can also use the bootstrap to estimate the generalization error. 
$$ \mathbb{E}[\rho(Y_{new}, m^*(X_{new}))] $$

* We draw a sample $(Z_1, ..., Z_n, Z_{new})$ from $\hat{P}$
* We compute the bootstrapped estimator $m(\cdot)$ based on the sample
* We estimate $\mathbb{E}[\rho(Y_{new}, m^*(X_{new}))]$, which is with respect 
  to both training and test data.

We can rewrite the generalization error as follows:
$$ \mathbb{E}[\rho(Y_{new}, m^*({X_{new}}^*))] = \mathbb{E}_{train}[E_{test}[\rho({Y_{new}}^*, m^*({X_{new}}^*))| train]]$$
Conditioning on the training data in the inner expectation, $m(\cdot)$ is 
non-random / fixed. The only random component is ${Y_{new}}^*$. Since we draw 
from the empirical distribution and place a probability mass of $1/n$ on every
data point. we can calculate the inner (discrete) expectation easily via 
$\mathbb{E}(X) = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^n p_j * x_j = n^{-1} \sum\limits_{j = 1}^n x_j$.
The expectation becomes. 
$$ \mathbb{E}_{train}[n^{-1}\sum\rho(Y_{i}, m^*(X_{i}))] =  n^{-1}\sum\mathbb{E}[\rho(Y_{i}, m^*(X_{i}))]$$

We can see that there is no need to draw $Z_{new}$ from the data. The final
algorithm looks as follows:

* Draw $Z_1, ..., Z_{N}$
* compute bootstrap estimator $\hat{\theta}^*$
* Evaluate this estimator on all data points and average over them, i.e 
  $err^* = n^{-1} \sum \rho(Y_i, m^*(X_i))$
* Repeat steps above B times and average all error estimates to get the
  bootstrap GE estimate, i.e. 
  $GE^* = B^{-1} \sum err_i$


## Out-of-Boostrap sample for estimating the GE
One can criticize the GE estimate above because some samples are used in the
**test as well as in the training set**. This leads to 
**over-optimistic estimations**
and can be avoided by using the out-of-bootstrap approach. With this technique,
we first generate a bootstrap sample to compute our estimator and then use
the remaining observations not used in the bootstrap sample to evaluate the
estimator. We do that $B$ times and the size of the test set may vary. You can
see this as some kind of cross-validation with about 30% of the data used as 
the test set. The difference is that some observations were used multiple times
in the training data, yielding a **training set always of size n** (instead of - 
for example $n*0.9$ for 10-fold-CV).

## Double Boostrap Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals are almost never exact, meaning that
$$\mathbb{P}[\theta \in I^{**}(1-\alpha)] = 1-\alpha + \Delta$$
Where $I^{**}(1-\alpha)$ is a $\alpha$-confidence interval.
However, by changing the *nominal* coverage of the confidence interval, it is 
possible to make the actual coverage equal to an arbitrary value, i.e

$$ \mathbb{P}[\theta \in I^{**}(1-\alpha')] = 1-\alpha$$
The problem is that $\alpha'$ is unknown. But another level of bootstrap can 
be used to **estimate** $\alpha$, denoted by $\hat{\alpha}$, which typically
achieves
$$\mathbb{P}[\theta \in I^{**}(1-\hat{\alpha}')] = 1-\alpha + \Delta'$$ with
$\Delta' \lt {\Delta}$

To implement a double bootstrap confidence interval, proceed as follows:

1. Draw a bootstrap sample $Z_1, ..., Z_n$
    a. From this sample, draw B second-level bootstrap samples and
       compute the estimator of interest and *one* confidence interval 
       $I^{**}(1-\alpha)$ based on B second-level bootstrap samples.
    c. evaluate whether $\hat{\theta}$ lays within the bootstrap confidence
       interval from a. $cover^*(1-\alpha) = 1_{[\hat{\theta} \in I^{**}(1-\alpha)]}$
2. Repeat the above M times to get $cover^{* 1}, ..., cover^{* M}$ and hence
   approximate $p^*(\alpha) = \mathbb{P}[\theta \in I^{**}(1-\alpha)]$ with 
   $$ M^{-1} \sum\limits_{m = 1}^M cover^{* m}$$
3. Vary $\alpha$ in all of the steps above to find $\alpha'$ so that 
$p^*(\alpha') = 1- \alpha$

## Three Versions of Boostrap

* So far, we discussed the **fully non-parametric** bootstrap, which is simulating
from the empirical distribution. 
* On the other extreme of the scale, there is the **parametric bootstrap**.
* The middle way is the model-based bootstrap

### Non-parametric Regression
We draw a bootstrap sample $(Z_1, ..., Z_n) \sim \hat{P}$, i.e. we sample from
the *empirical distribution* data with replacement.

### Parametric Boostrap
Here, we assume the data are realizations from a *known* distribution $P$,
which is is determined up to some unknown parameter (vector) $\theta$. That
means we sample $(Z_1, ..., Z_n) \sim P_{\hat{\theta}}$.
For example, take the following regression model $ y = X\beta + \epsilon $ where
we know the errors are Gaussian. 

1. We can estimate our regression model, obtain residuals and compute the mean 
   (which is zero) and the standard deviation of them. 
2. To generate a bootstrap sample 
   $(Z_1^*, ..., Z_n^*), \;Z_i^* = (Y_i^*, X_i^*)$, we simulate residuals 
   $\epsilon^*$ from $N(0, \hat{\mu})$ and 
3. Add them to our observed data, i.e. we obtain 
   $({Y_1}^*, ..., {Y_n}^*)$ from $X\beta + \epsilon^*$. Hence, the final bootstrap 
   sample we use is $(x_1, {Y_1}^*), ..., (x_1, {Y_n}^*))$ where the $x_i$ are
   just the observed data.
4. We can compute bootstrap estimates $\hat{\beta}^*$, the bootstrap expectation 
   $\mathbb{E}^*[\beta*]$ as well as confidence intervals for the regression 
   coefficients or generalization errors just as shown in detail above. The
   difference is only *how* the bootstrap sample is obtained.
   
Similarly, for time series data, we may assume an AR(p) model. 

1. Initializing $X_0, ..., X_{-p+1}$ with $0$.
2. Generate random noise $\epsilon_1, ..., \epsilon_{n+m}$ according to 
   $P_{\hat{\theta}}$.
3. Construct our time series 
   ${X_t}^* = \sum\limits_{j = 1}^p \theta*{X_{t-j}}^* + {\epsilon_t}^*$ 
   $(X_1, ..., X_{n+m})$
4. Throw away the first $M$ observations that were used as fade-in.
5. Proceed with the B bootstrap samples $({X_1}^*, ..., {X_n}^*)$ as outlined
   above for the non-parametric bootstrap to obtain coefficient estimates for
   $\theta$, confidence intervals or estimating the generalization error of the
   model.

### Model-Based Bootstrap
The middle way is the model based bootstrap. As with the parametric bootstrap,
we assume to know the model, e.g. $y = m(x) + \epsilon$ (where $m(\cdot)$ might
be a non-parametric curve estimator), but we do not make an assumption about 
the error distribution. Instead of generating $\epsilon^*$ from the known
distribution with unknown parameters ($\epsilon^* \sim P_{\hat{\theta}}$, as 
in the parametric bootstrap)), we draw them with replacement from the *empirical* 
distribution. To sum it up, these are the steps necessary:

1. Estimate $\hat{m(\cdot)}$ from all data.
2. Simulate ${\epsilon_1}^*, ..., {\epsilon_n}^*$ by drawing from $\hat{P}$ with
   replacement.
3. Obtain $({Y_1}^*, ..., {Y_n}^*)$ from $m(x) + \epsilon^*$. As for the 
   parametric bootstrap, the final bootstrap sample we use is 
   $(x_1, {Y_1}^*), ..., (x_1, {Y_n}^*))$ where the $x_i$ are just the observed 
   data.
4. Again, you can use the bootstrap samples as for the other two methods.

## Conclusion
Which version of the bootstrap should I use? The answer is classical. If the
parametric model fits the data very well, there is no need to estimate the
distribution explicitly. Also, if there is very little data, it might be very
difficult to estimate $P$. On the other hand, the non-parametric bootstrap 
is less sensitive to model-misspecification and can deal with arbitrary 
distributions (? is that true?).
