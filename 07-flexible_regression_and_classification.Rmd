The curse of dimensionality makes it very hard to estimate fully non-parametric 
regression function $\hat{m} = \mathbb{E}[Y|X = x]$ or classification function 
$\hat{\pi}_j = \mathbb{P}[Y = j | X = x]$. Hence, by making some (reasonable) 
structural assumptions, we can improve our models significantly. Generally, we 
consider the mapping $\mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{P}$ via the function 
$g(\cdot)$ for both the regression and the classification problem.
